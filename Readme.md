## [Data wrangling, cleaning, analysis and visualization on WeRateDogs Twiter](https://github.com/LucianoBesada/Twitter_WeRateDogs_Wrangling_and_Analysys/blob/main/wrangle_act.ipynb)

Project developed using three main different sources:
1. File on hand: "twitter-archive-enhanced.csv"
2. File programmatically downloaded from the Internet: "image-predictions.tsv"
3. Data from Twitter API: "tweet_json"

The aim is to be able to answer the followings:
- What dog breeds have the most number of likes among Twitter users?
- What pictures of dog breeds have been most shared among Twitter users?
- How do Twitter users refer most to their dogs?
- Is there any particular attribute or object that makes a dog popular among Twitter users?Â¶

For security reasons, credentials on how to access the data on _Twitter API_ are not shared.
